# Framework specific recipes

It's no secret that most of the frontend work nowadays is being done using some of the popular frameworks: React, Angular or Vue. Follow these recipes to easily plug in Notyf in your favorite framework.

## Recipes

- [React](react.md)
- [Vue](vue.md)
- [Angular](angular.md): You can also use [ng-notyf](https://github.com/jdjuan/ng-notyf).
- [Global](global.md)

## Disclaimer

I'm not an expert in React or Vue. The recipes are only a result of personal research, experimenting and testing. Please feel free to open an issue if you think a recipe doesn't reflect a best practice or if the proposed recipe is totally wrong.

## Contributing

I'd love to have recipes for more frameworks but I'm not particularly interested in researching more into it. I kindly welcome any PR if you're interested in adding your own recipe here.
